            <b><u>My Background</u></b>
            <br>
            I was born in Malaysia in 2005,in the state of Melaka.

            I then grew up in Melaka before moving to Singapore in 2009.

            <b><u>Family</u></b>
            <br>
            I am the youngest in a family of four and have an older sister.
            <br>
            I have a large extended family with many uncles and aunts ( which most I still dont know still this day),
            <br>

            <b><u>Friends</u></b>
            <br>
            I believe I have a tighter circle than most however in school I am friends with most of my classmates and am closer with a group,
            <br>
            and we call ourselves the healthgoblins as a joke.Outside of school, I have a friend group for badminton and another friend group for gaming. :D
